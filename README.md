Fraud Detection Using K-Neighbor Classifier

The dataset is a list of financial transactions on PaySim,  mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. T. Since the datasets is more than 25MB, i couldn't upload it here on github. Anyway, you can find the datasets in this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1. 

You can use other supervised machine learning methods to do this problem. It took a while to train the data because the data have more than 600k columns. I've tried a cross validation method in this problem, since the data is too big it took me more than 8 hours and the code still running until i stopped it.
